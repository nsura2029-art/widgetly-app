## 1. The problem we're solving

The Widgetly site runs on **Cloudflare Workers (Free)** via
`@opennextjs/cloudflare`. We've started seeing Error 1102 randomly —
sometimes on first request after deploy, sometimes on `/api/*`,
sometimes on marketing pages. Root cause is structural: **Workers
Free is too tight for what we're doing**.

### Current Cloudflare Workers Free limits (2026)

| Limit                 | Free            | Paid ($5/mo)                | Why it matters for us                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU time / request    | **10 ms**       | 30 s default, 5 min max     | Next.js SSR with RSC, i18n, framer-motion can blow past 10 ms |
| Requests / day        | 100,000         | 10 M included, then $0.30/M | We're at ~25K/day and growing — Free ceiling in sight         |
| Memory / isolate      | 128 MB          | 128 MB                      | Same on both — not the lever                                  |
| Worker size           | 3 MB compressed | 10 MB compressed            | Next.js bundle is ~5 MB — **already over the Free cap**       |
| Subrequests / request | 50              | 1,000                       | Limits fan-out per render                                     |
| Workers per account   | 100             | 500                         | Not an issue                                                  |

**Error 1102** triggers in two cases:

1. **Exceeded CPU time.** Worker Free gives 10 ms of CPU per request.
   That's _incredibly_ tight. A bare-bones React Server Component
   render with i18n message loading + JSON-LD generation already
   uses 4–8 ms. Adding middleware (locale cookie write, anon UUID
   generation) eats another 1–2 ms. **First cold-start render often
   exceeds 10 ms.** This is the [opennextjs-cloudflare#598 bug][1]
   pattern.

2. **Exceeded memory (128 MB).** Less likely at our scale but
   possible on tool-page renders with all 11 category landing pages
   inlined into JSON-LD.

The **3 MB compressed Worker size limit** is also a quiet threat.
`@opennextjs/cloudflare` builds typically land between 4–8 MB.
Once we're over 3 MB the deploy _succeeds_ on the dashboard but
the Worker refuses to start at runtime — also surfacing as a 5xx,
sometimes as 1102.

### What 1102 actually looks like in the wild

Symptoms seen on `widgetly.tech` between 2026-06-15 and 2026-06-18:

- **First request after deploy** — Worker cold-start renders the
  home page, hits 1102 because the isolate just initialized.
  Subsequent requests succeed.
- **Random hits on `/api/waitlist` / `/api/suggest`** — these hit
  D1, do JSON parsing, and write a small response. On Free, the
  10 ms budget is consumed by `headers()` + D1 round-trip + JSON
  encoding. ~3% of writes fail with 1102.
- **Tool pages with `force-static` working OK**, but the home page
  has subtle dynamic opt-ins (the cookie banner consults `cookies()`
  on first render) — sometimes 1102 on cold.

### What it isn't

It's not a code bug per se. The Next.js renderer is doing exactly
what it's told. The budget is just wrong for the workload.

## 2. The architectural fix: cache static at the edge, Worker only for `/api/*`

The whole point of a CDN is to serve the same bytes 10,000 times
without re-running the program. Today we're re-running the program
(SSR) for every request and then _also_ spending Worker CPU on
middleware. That's backwards.

The fix has three layers, applied in order:

### Layer A — Eliminate dynamic rendering everywhere we can

Audit the app and remove anything that opts a page into dynamic
rendering. Goal: **every marketing/content page is `force-static`
and prerendered at build time**.

| Surface                                       | Today                                                               | Target                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/[locale]/layout.tsx`                        | Already static; removed `headers()` call.                           | ✅ keep                                                                     |
| `/[locale]/page.tsx` (home)                   | Was `force-dynamic`; now default-static.                            | ✅ keep                                                                     |
| `/[locale]/tools/[category]/[tool]/page.tsx`  | `force-static`, prerendered for 109 tools × 3 locales = 327 pages   | ✅ keep                                                                     |
| `/[locale]/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`              | `force-static`                                                      | ✅ keep                                                                     |
| `/[locale]/sitemap.ts`                        | `force-dynamic` (reads site config + tool list at request time)     | 🔴 rewrite to import tool data statically at build time                     |
| `/[locale]/robots.ts`                         | `force-dynamic`                                                     | 🟡 probably fine to keep dynamic — robots.txt is small + rarely-hit         |
| `/[locale]/suggest/page.tsx`                  | `force-dynamic` (reads D1)                                          | 🔴 keep dynamic OR remove the `/suggest/` UI and only expose `/api/suggest` |
| `/[locale]/opengraph-image.tsx` (and similar) | Server-side image generation; counts as CPU                         | 🔴 pre-generate OG images at build time using `next/og` + a build step      |
| Middleware                                    | Sets `wly_locale` + `wly_anon` cookies, runs `next-intl` middleware | 🟡 see Layer C — skip middleware when the page is cacheable                 |

### Layer B — Aggressive edge caching with `Cache-Control` + Cache Rules

Set `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate=86400`
on every prerendered route. Use a **Cloudflare Cache Rule** to:

- Cache HTML at the edge with the matching `s-maxage`.
- Bypass the cache for `/api/*`, `/_next/*`, `*.json` (already
  excluded), and any route that sets its own `Cache-Control:
no-store`.

> **Important gotcha** — `public/_headers` on a Cloudflare Workers
> (OpenNext) deployment **only applies to files served from the
> Worker's `[assets]` binding** (i.e. the `.open-next/assets/`
> directory). It does NOT apply to dynamic HTML responses from
> Next.js SSR. Cache-Control for dynamic routes MUST be set via
> `next.config.ts → headers()`. We learned this the hard way when
> the first deploy showed `/en` still returning the default
> `s-maxage=31536000` (from Next's own defaults) instead of our
> intended `s-maxage=300`. The `_headers` rules for HTML routes
> were silently ignored.

Then 99% of HTML requests never hit the Worker at all. They hit
Cloudflare's edge cache (which is essentially free and unlimited),
and the bytes fly out at <30 ms TTFB globally.

The trick: **don't run the middleware on cached HTML**. Two ways:

1. **Cloudflare Cache Rule** that bypasses the Worker for cached
   GETs that already have a hit. (Workers are bypassed when a
   Cache Rule serves from cache _and_ the page is a static asset
   match — but for HTML, the Worker still runs by default.)
2. **Move cookie-setting out of middleware.** Instead, set
   `wly_locale` from a client-side script on first visit (or from
   the API route that already exists). The middleware only runs
   for non-cached requests, which is fine.

The cleanest implementation: a Cloudflare Cache Rule with the
expression

```
(http.host eq "widgetly.tech" and http.request.method eq "GET"
 and not starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/api/")
 and not starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/_next/")
 and not starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/diag"))
```

…set to **Cache eligible status codes** (200, 203, 204, 300–399,
404, 408, 410, 418, 451) with **Edge TTL = respect existing
headers** and **Browser TTL = 0**.

#### Layer B dashboard walkthrough (Cache Rules form)

The actual Cache Rules form (verified 2026-06-18 against the live
dashboard) has **only the radio + 6 expandable settings**, no
"Eligible status codes" checkboxes section. Every setting is
gated behind a `+ Add setting` button that reveals its controls.
Walk through:

**Step 1 — Rule name** (top of the form, plain text field):
`Cache HTML pages at edge`

**Step 2 — Match expression** (next section):
Click **Edit expression**, switch to **Expression Editor**, paste:

```
(http.host eq "widgetly.tech" and http.request.method eq "GET"
 and not starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/api/")
 and not starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/_next/")
 and not starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/diag/"))
```

**Step 3 — Cache eligibility** (radio buttons):
Pick **Eligible for cache** (not Bypass cache).

**Step 4 — Add the settings you need** (each is `+ Add setting`):

| Setting                                    | What to pick                                                                                                                                  | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Edge TTL**                               | Click `+ Add setting`, then in the dropdown pick **Status code TTL** (recommended). Configure the per-status-code mapping in the table below. | **Status code TTL** is the bulletproof choice — it maps each status-code range to an explicit TTL, so even if origin accidentally sends `Cache-Control` on a 5xx response, the rule prevents caching. The simpler mode **Use cache-control header if present, bypass cache if not** also works, but relies on origin never setting cacheable headers on errors. |

| **Cache key**                              | Leave **NOT** added (defaults are fine)                                                                                                       | Adding this exposes include/exclude fields. Defaults already exclude cookies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Serve stale content while revalidating** | Click `+ Add setting`, toggle **ON**, set duration to **86400** seconds (1 day)                                                               | This is what enables SWR on the edge even if origin is slow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

##### Edge TTL: Status code TTL — per-code mapping

After picking **Status code TTL** in the Edge TTL dropdown, click
**+ Add status code TTL** once per row. The fields are:

- **Status code range** — pick from dropdown:
  - `Equal to` (single code)
  - `Greater than or equal to`
  - `Less than or equal to`
  - `From ... to` (range)
- **Status codes** — numeric field(s) depending on the range picker
- **TTL (seconds)** — positive int, `0` for no-cache, `-1` for no-store

Use these rows (recommended):

| Status code range                          | TTL (seconds) | Why                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200` to `299` (success)                   | `86400`       | Cache successful responses for 1 day. Matches what we want long-term.                         |
| `300` to `399` (redirects)                 | `86400`       | Cache redirects (e.g. `/` → `/en`) so they don't hit the Worker.                              |
| `400` to `499` (client errors, except 404) | `60`          | Cache bad-request responses briefly so a misbehaving client doesn't pound the Worker.         |
| `404` (not found)                          | `300`         | Cache 404s for 5 min — same as our HTML TTL — so a deleted tool page doesn't slam the Worker. |
| `500` to `599` (server errors)             | `0`           | **Never cache 5xx.** Even a one-time Worker 1102 must not become a 5-minute global outage.    |

You can skip the `400-499` and `404` rows if you want — the
default (no entry for that range) means Cloudflare falls back to
the mode's default behavior. The two critical rows are:

- `200-299` → `86400` (cache successes)
- `500-599` → `0` (never cache errors)

The dropdown in the form asks for **range or single code** in a
specific UI. To replicate the API example below, enter:

- **Greater than or equal to** + `200`, **less than or equal to** `299` → `86400`
- **Greater than or equal to** `500` → `0` (no-cache)

API equivalent (for reference; the dashboard form does this for you):

```json
"edge_ttl": {
  "mode": "respect_origin",
  "status_code_ttl": [
    { "status_code_range": { "from": 200, "to": 299 }, "value": 86400 },
    { "status_code_range": { "from": 300, "to": 399 }, "value": 86400 },
    { "status_code_range": { "from": 400, "to": 499 }, "value": 60 },
    { "status_code_range": { "status_code": 404 }, "value": 300 },
    { "status_code_range": { "from": 500 }, "value": 0 }
  ]
}
```

Note the `mode: "respect_origin"` — when a status-code range
doesn't match a row, Cloudflare still respects the origin's
Cache-Control header. This means our `next.config.ts` setting
of `s-maxage=300` wins for 200s even though the rule says 86400,
because `respect_origin` means "if origin said cache for 300s,
cache for 300s, not 86400." If you want the rule's TTL to
**override** origin, switch the mode to `override_origin`.

**About "Eligible status codes"** — this is NOT a separate section
on the form. Status-code filtering is handled **by the Status
code TTL section above** (the `200-299 → 86400`, `500-599 → 0`
rows). Every status code that's not in your mapping falls back
to the Edge TTL mode (we use `respect_origin`, so it falls back
to honoring origin's Cache-Control).

**Step 5 — Deploy**. Click the blue **Deploy** button at the
bottom right.

**Verify**:

```bash
# First request: cache miss
curl -sI https://widgetly.tech/en | grep -iE 'cf-cache-status|cache-control'
#  → cf-cache-status: MISS
#  → cache-control: public, s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate=86400

# Second request: cache hit (rule is working)
curl -sI https://widgetly.tech/en | grep -i cf-cache-status
#  → cf-cache-status: HIT

# /api/* should be bypassed (not in our expression)
curl -sI https://widgetly.tech/api/region | grep -iE 'cf-cache-status|cache-control'
#  → cf-cache-status: BYPASS
#  → cache-control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
```

### Layer C — Strip the dynamic API surface down to what's actually needed

Today we have 6 API routes (`contact`, `diag/consent`, `diag/d1`,
`locale`, `openapi.json`, `region`, `suggest`, `waitlist`). Each
runs as a Worker invocation. With the Free 10 ms budget:

- `/api/region` — reads `cf-ipcountry` header. ~1 ms CPU.
  ✅ fine.
- `/api/diag/*` — dev-only, blocked in prod.
  ✅ fine.
- `/api/openapi.json` — serves a static spec file.
  🔴 should be a static asset, not a route.
- `/api/locale` — reads cookies + writes KV.
  🟡 fine; KV write is fast.
- `/api/contact`, `/api/waitlist`, `/api/suggest` — write to D1.
  🔴 most likely 1102 source. Optimize the D1 round-trip path.

### Layer D — Bundle size and cold-start improvements

Even on Paid, smaller is faster. Three things help:

1. **Disable production source maps** — already done (`productionBrowserSourceMaps: false`).
2. **Mark dynamic-only packages as external** — `lucide-react`,
   `framer-motion` are already in `optimizePackageImports`. Add
   `@supabase/supabase-js` if it's still bundled.
3. **Audit the Workers bundle.** Run `pnpm exec wrangler deploy
--dry-run --outdir=dist` and inspect `dist/worker.js`. Anything
   over 5 MB is a warning sign on Free.

## 3. Plan / next Cloudflare tier

### Stay on Free (current): $0/mo

- ✅ Works for prerendered static marketing site
- ❌ 10 ms CPU too tight for SSR
- ❌ 3 MB Worker size too tight for OpenNext bundle
- ❌ 100K req/day ceiling in sight at current growth

### Recommended: **Workers Paid** at $5/mo

- ✅ **30 s CPU default per request** (5 min max) — SSR runs without 1102.
- ✅ **10 M requests/mo included**, then $0.30/M. We're at ~25K/day
  = ~750K/mo — fits comfortably.
- ✅ **10 MB Worker size** — fits OpenNext bundle.
- ✅ **1,000 subrequests** per request — D1 fan-out is fine.
- ✅ **No daily request cap** — no more worrying about traffic spikes.
- ✅ **Same dashboard**, instant upgrade, no migration needed.
- ❌ Minimum $5/mo charge even if site is idle.

**Decision rule:** upgrade as soon as we hit either (a) ~50K req/day
sustained or (b) the next 1102 incident from a real user, whichever
comes first. Until then, the cache-first optimization (Layer B)
should suppress 1102 on marketing pages even on Free.

### When to consider the next tier ($25/mo Pro)

`Workers Paid` is the developer-platform plan. The site-level
**Cloudflare Pro** ($25/mo) is a separate upgrade that adds:

- ✅ WAF managed rules + Bot Fight Mode (security)
- ✅ Advanced DDoS protection
- ✅ Polish: 100% uptime SLA, priority support
- ✅ Image Resizing, Polish (image optimization)
- ❌ Does NOT raise Workers limits (still uses Workers Paid sub-$$)

**Decision rule:** upgrade to Pro when we care about uptime SLA
and/or when security becomes a board-level concern. For a pre-launch
catalog site, Pro is premature.

### When to consider **Workers Enterprise** (custom)

- 5-minute cron triggers
- Logpush to S3/BigQuery
- Multi-region Smart Placement
- Higher concurrent connection limits

Not relevant until we have paying customers or compliance needs.

| --- | --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | 🔴  | Add `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate=86400` to all `force-static` pages via `public/_headers` (Cloudflare convention)                                                                                       | Edge-caches 99% of HTML at <30 ms TTFB; Worker not invoked                  |
| 2   | 🔴  | Create a Cloudflare Cache Rule for `widgetly.tech` matching `(host eq "widgetly.tech") and (method eq "GET") and not (path starts with "/api/" or "/_next/" or "/diag")` — set edge TTL = respect existing headers, browser TTL = 0     | Belt-and-suspenders with #1; catches static assets too                      |
| 3   | 🔴  | Rewrite `sitemap.ts` to import tool list statically so it can be `force-static` and prerendered at build                                                                                                                                | Avoids 1 dynamic render per sitemap fetch                                   |
| 4   | 🟡  | Move `wly_locale` / `wly_anon` cookie writes out of `src/middleware.ts` into the client-side `useConsent` script that already exists, OR keep them but make them conditional on `Cache-Control: no-store` (i.e. only run on cache miss) | Saves ~1–2 ms CPU per request on cached pages                               |
| 5   | 🟡  | Move `/api/openapi.json` from a route handler to a static file under `public/`                                                                                                                                                          | Eliminates an entire Worker invocation per request                          |
| 6   | 🟡  | Pre-generate OG images at build time (currently server-rendered per request, hits 10 ms budget)                                                                                                                                         | Eliminates image-render CPU on first-share preview                          |
| 7   | 🟡  | Add `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` to `/_next/static/*` and `/icons/*` via `_headers`                                                                                                                             | Already cached by Cloudflare by default; make it explicit                   |
| 8   | 🟡  | Audit `wrangler deploy --dry-run` output — if Worker > 5 MB, switch to `nodejs_compat_v2` + drop `global_fetch_strictly_public` if unused                                                                                               | Keeps bundle under Free limit if we stay on Free                            |
| 9   | 🟢  | Switch `/api/contact`, `/api/waitlist`, `/api/suggest` to use `caches.default` (Workers Cache API) keyed by request body for idempotent reads                                                                                           | Caches duplicate POSTs — relevant once we're on Paid with bigger CPU budget |
| 10  | 🟢  | When 1102 persists despite #1–#8, upgrade to **Workers Paid** ($5/mo). 30 s CPU makes the whole class of issues disappear                                                                                                               | Insurance policy                                                            |

## 6. What "Worker only for API" actually looks like

After #1–#7 are in, the request flow for a typical homepage visit:

```
Browser GET /en
   │
   ▼
Cloudflare edge (POP nearest user, ~300 globally)
   │
   ├─ Cache hit? ──── yes ──→ serve cached HTML bytes directly
   │                          (no Worker invocation, no CPU used)
   │                          TTFB: ~10–30 ms
   │
   └─ Cache miss ───→ invoke Worker
                       │
                       ├─ Run middleware (locale detect)
                       ├─ Run Next.js SSR for /[locale]
                       ├─ Render JSON-LD
                       ├─ Return HTML + Cache-Control header
                       │
                       ▼
                     Cloudflare caches the response (s-maxage=300)
                     Next request is a cache hit
```

For `/api/waitlist` (POST):

```
Browser POST /api/waitlist
   │
   ▼
Cloudflare edge
   │
   └─ Cache Rule bypasses /api/* ──→ invoke Worker (every time)
                                      │
                                      ├─ Read body (Zod validate)
                                      ├─ INSERT INTO D1
                                      ├─ Return { ok: true }
                                      │
                                      ▼
                                     Response back to client
                                     TTFB: ~50–150 ms (D1 + Worker)
```

That's the model: **HTML = free at edge, API = paid in Workers**.
It matches the user's instinct and matches the Cloudflare design.

## 7. Verification

After each layer is implemented, re-verify against:

| Check                               | Command / URL                                                      | Pass criterion                          |

| Worker bundle size                  | `pnpm exec wrangler deploy --dry-run`                              | < 10 MB compressed                      |
| Edge cache hit rate                 | Cloudflare dashboard → Analytics → Cache                           | > 90% on `/[locale]/...` routes         |
| Error 1102 rate                     | Cloudflare dashboard → Workers → Errors                            | < 0.1% of invocations                   |
| Worker CPU time p95                 | Same                                                               | < 5 ms on cached routes                 |
| HTML TTFB (warm cache)              | `curl -w "%{time_starttransfer}" https://widgetly.tech/en`         | < 50 ms                                 |
| HTML TTFB (cold cache)              | Same after cache purge                                             | < 500 ms                                |
| API response time                   | `curl -w "%{time_starttransfer}" https://widgetly.tech/api/region` | < 200 ms                                |

When all rows are green, the 1102 class of issues is over.
